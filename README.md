## 📁 File Structure

```
Portfolio/
│
├── final.html          # Main and only webpage file

## ⚙️ How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository (e.g., `portfolio` or `aritra-portfolio`).

2. Upload all project files, including `final.html` and your images.

3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Branch:** `main` and Folder: `/ (root)`

4. Your site will be live at:

   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

   Example: `https://aritraparui.github.io/portfolio/`

5. Rename `final.html` to `index.html` (optional but recommended) so GitHub Pages loads it automatically.

---

## 🧠 Customization

* Update your **email** and **LinkedIn link** in the Contact section.
* Replace the two sample images with your own photos.
* If you use **Web3Forms**, insert your unique access key into the form’s `action` attribute.

---

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Add a Projects section with live demos and GitHub links
* Integrate form handling with Web3Forms or Formspree
* Add subtle parallax effects or a scroll progress bar
